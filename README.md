# Just another CV32E40P equivalent core
This is a hobby project to design a 5-stage pipeline RISCV processor as altertive for CV32E40P.

## Objective of this project
1. 5-stage pipeline implementation using verilog/sv
2. Decent performance
3. Develop with free/open-source tool
4. Verification using UVM
5. Extended goal is to experiment full ASIC flow (synthesis, P&R, GDSII), STA, DFT, UPF, Formal Verification, STA, etc

## Plan
As this is a hobby project, it is safe to spend one hour everyday and 2 hours over the weekend. Therefore, the schedule can't be too aggressive
1. Setting up development Environment - 1 week (Ubuntu based)
2. ISA analysis - 1 week
3. Microarchitecture design (5-stage pipeline) - 1 week
4. Test Plan - 1 week
5. RTL implementation - 10 weeks
6. Functional verification - 10 weeks (direct testbench)
7. Verification (UVM) environment setup - 10 weeks
8. Systhesis - 2 weeks
9. DFT - 2 weeks
10. STA - 2 weeks
11. P&R - 4 weeks
12. GDSII generation - 4 weeks
13. UPF & clock gating - 4 weeks
14. Formal Verification - 4 weeks
